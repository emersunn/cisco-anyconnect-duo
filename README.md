# Cisco Anyconnect with Duo

This script automates the process of connecting to a VPN using Cisco AnyConnect on macOS, with MacOS Keychain for password storage and Duo authentication for second-factor authentication.

## Features

- Automatically retrieves VPN password from the macOS Keychain
- If the password is not found in the Keychain, prompts for input and stores it securely
- Supports three Duo authentication methods: push, phone, and SMS
- Temporarily stores credentials in a secure file for the duration of the connection process
- Automatically removes the temporary credentials file after use

## Requirements

- Cisco AnyConnect client installed on macOS
- Duo authentication set up for the VPN

## Usage

1. Open the script with a text editor and replace the following variables:

  - VPN_HOST: Replace with your VPN server's hostname or IP address
  - VPN_USER: Replace with your VPN username
  - VPN_PASSWORD: Leave blank to use the Keychain password
  - DUO_FACTOR: Can be "push", "phone" or "sms"
  - KEYCHAIN_ITEM: Can be any name you prefer, this example creates a Keychain item called "AnyConnect-foo.bar"

2. Save the script, and then run it in a terminal window. The script will either connect to the VPN using the stored Keychain password or prompt for input if the password is not found.

3. (recommended) Assign the script to a keystroke or shortcut.

If you wish to create a separate script for disconnecting from the VPN, create a new file with the following content:

```
echo "Disconnectingâ€¦"
/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn disconnect
```
## Troubleshooting

- If you've entered the wrong VPN password and the script is not allowing you to enter the correct one, open the Keychain Access app on your Mac, find the Keychain item (the default is "AnyConnect-foo.bar"), delete it, and then run the script again.

## Disclaimer

Use this script at your own risk. Always follow your organization's security policies and guidelines.
